        <h6>GOAL</h6>
        <br>
        <p>
        The goal of the guild is to clear all available raid tiers, as fast as possible within our 1-2 raiding days.
        We put a big focus on structure and dedication - we are not a hardcore guild in terms of hours played, but we take a serious approach to our raids and time we spend together as a guild.

        <h6>EXPECTATIONS OF A RAIDER</h6>
        <br>
        <p>
            To reach our goal as a guild and to maintain a high level of play, some expectations have to be met for a player to gain and keep the rank as raider in Vanguard.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are required to have a good understanding of your class. This means showing up in the right spec, having a good understanding of how to utilise this spec and pursue the right gear that fits this spec.
            Having a good approach to gear should include three things. Farm your pre-bis outside of raids, enchant all received raid gear with highest level enchants, and have a good understanding of what items you will need from each raid tier.
            All raiders are required to have a high raid performance. This can be achieved by having good logs, high attendance, a healthy attitude and good raid preparation. High performance will be determined on a per case basis, but it’s important that all raiders have a mature approach to both receiving and giving feedback if we spot lower level of performance in some areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Show interest in the community. This means keeping up to date with the announcements and things happening within the guild. And last but not least, be nice to your fellow raiders and members.
        </p>

            <center><b>It’s important to highlight that we look at all of these factors when considering promotions, and everything is based on a per player basis. We do not expect everybody to be perfect in all aspects, but we will look at the whole picture when considering promotions.</b></center>

        <h6>RAIDING</h6>
        <br>
        <p>
        Vanguard is raiding 1-2 days during the week, Wednesday and Sunday 20:00 cet - 23:00 cet ( invites start at 19:30 cet). Wednesday will only be used if we are falling behind on content or cant clear the raids we want during the Sunday raid.
        We start the raids at 20:00 cet, all raiders have to be present on Discord, invited to the raid group and zoned in by then. You should have a good understanding of each encounter before the raids start, and have prepared all consumables from the raid consumable kit.
        It is important that all members contribute to a good raiding environment, this mean treating each other with respect. And in case disputes happens, please bring it up with a member of the council.

        <h6>STANDBY</h6>
        <br>
        <p>
        When a raid has more than 40 signups the raid leader has the opportunity to move people to the bench.  As a player you are not allowed to bench yourself.
        Benched people have the option to go on standby at raid start. People on standby can be used if someone doesn’t show up, or if we are  required to swap classes during an encounter/raid. People on standby will receive full EP but are required to stay active for the full duration of the raid (20:00-23:00).
        How to go on standby?:
        When invites go out, sign in by dropping a message in the standby channel on Discord. You can sign in between 19:30 and 20:00.
        Sign out by dropping a message in the standby channel on Discord when the raid is done.
        All communication regarding standby players will be made in the standby discord channel. If you are called upon during a raid we require you to respond within 5 minutes, or you will be seen as inactive and will lose the rights to earn EP from the current raid.
        People that are benched are NOT required to go on standby.
